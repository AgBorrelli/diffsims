PyCrystEM (Python Crystallographic Electron Microscopy) is an open-source Python library for crystallographic electron microscopy.

PyCrystEM builds on the tools for multi-dimensional data analysis provided by the HyperSpy library for treatment of experimental electron diffraction data and tools for atomic structure manipulation provided by the PyMatGen library.

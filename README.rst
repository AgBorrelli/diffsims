pyXem is an open-source python library for crystallographic electron microscopy.

The package defines objects and functions for the analysis of numerous electron diffraction patterns and has been primarily developed as a platform for hybrid diffraction-imaging microscopy based on 4D scanning electron diffraction (SED) data. Installation instructions, documentation and tutorial examples are available `here <http://pyxem.github.io/pyxem>`__ .

If analysis using pyXem forms a part of published work please cite the DOI at the top of this page. 

pyXem is released under the GPL v3 license.
